# ovos-tools 

This repository has documentation, scripts and other files to install and work with the Open Voice Operating System (OVOS).

This README document describes how to build a *Personal Voice Assistant* from the ground up.

## The build

The environment used to develop the code and write this document is a RasPi 4B with 4 GB of memory, running Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 inside an *enclosure*.  Details on the hardware and CNC G-code to build a *smart boombox* are here: https://github.com/mike99mac/ovos-tools/tree/main/gcode

The Raspberry Pi OS (aka Raspbian) versions 10 (buster) and 11 (bullseye) were also tested. However, this code and these steps should be relatively portable to any hardware that can run any Linux. 

The overall steps to build an OVOS box are:

- Acquire the hardware 
- Flash Linux to a memory device
- Connect the hardware
- Install and configure Linux
- Install and use ovos-tools
- Test microphone and speakers
- Install and configure OVOS 
- Start Minimy and use it!

## Acquire the hardware
The recommended hardware is a Raspberry Pi (RasPi) 4B, or 400 with 4 or 8 GB of memory.  The RasPi 5 is now available and is more powerful and hopefully easier to procure than the 4 was.


For a microphone, a flat, disk type with a mute/unmute switch for visible privacy is recommended.  Don't use a cheap one.  It is best to move the microphone away from the speakers and closer to the center of the room.

You can start with just about any speaker(s) with a 3.5mm jack that will plug into the RasPi.  A *DAC HAT* plugged on top of the RasPi will greatly improve audio quality.

## Flash Linux to a memory device
The RasPi boots from a micro-SD card that plugs into its underside. A 32 GB card or larger is recommended. You need to *prime the pump* and copy a Linux distribution to it. 

The following three flavors of two Linux distributions are supported. Note that *Raspbian* has been renamed to *Raspberry Pi OS* but in many places the original name is still used.
- ``Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS``
    - LTS stands for *Long Term Support* - Canonical promises to support it for at least five years.
- ``Raspbian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)``
- ``Raspbian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)``

### Prepare on Linux

If you have a Linux box with an SD card port, you can use **``rpi-imager``** to copy the Linux image. To do so, perform the following tasks.
- Put a micro-SD card into an SD adapter.
- Plug the SD adapter into the card reader.
- If you don't have it already, install the tool.

    **``$ sudo apt-get install -y rpi-imager``**

- Run the tool.

    **``$ rpi-imager``**
    
    You should see a window as shown in the following figure. **TODO**: add a screenshot

![](parts-front-view.jpg)
*Front view of boombox carcass and parts*


- To flash a Linux image to the card, perform the following steps:

    - Select one of three choices from *Operating System*.
        - Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) Debian Bullseye with Desktop
        - Raspberry Pi OS (legacy) => Debian Buster with Desktop
        - Other General Purpose OS => Ubuntu => Desktop 22.04.2 LTS (64-bit)

    - Select the *Storage* device. You should see just one micro-SD card in the dropdown menu. If you don't see any entry, your SD card has not been recognized.

    - Click **Write**.

    - If you are challenged for credentials, enter the password of the current user.

You should see a progress indicator as the image is copied to the SD card. It should take around 5 minutes.

### Prepare an SD card on Windows
If you only have access to a Windows system Install the *Win 32 disk imager* from https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/

There is now a port of **``rpi-imager``** to Windows. See: https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_latest.exe

## Connect the hardware

For the initial setup, a keyboard, monitor and mouse are needed. You can access the Internet using either Wi-Fi or with an Ethernet cable.

To connect all the computer hardware, perform the following steps:

- Plug the micro-SD card into the back underside of the RasPi.
- If you have wired ethernet, plug it in to the RJ-45 connector on the RasPi.
- Connect the mouse and keyboard to the USB slots.
- Connect the monitor to the RasPi with an appropriate micro-HDMI cable.  The RasPi 4 two micro HDMI ports - only the left one sends output at boot time.
- If you have a USB drive with music files on it, plug it in to a USB slot.
- Now that all the other hardware is connected, plug the 5v power supply with a USB-C end into the RasPi 4. An official RasPi power supply is recommended to avoid *undervoltage* warnings.  If you have an inline switch, turn it on.

## Install and configure Linux

To install and configure Ubuntu Desktop Linux, perform the following sections.

- Boot the RasPi
- Initial Ubuntu Desktop configuration -or- Initial Raspbian Desktop configuration
- Install the SSH server
- Start a terminal or SSH session
- Update and upgrade your system

### Boot the RasPi

When you supply power to the RasPi, it should start booting.  On the top, back, left side of a RasPi 4 there are two LEDs:

- The LED to the left should glow solid red. This signifies it has 5V DC power.
- The LED to the right should flicker green. This signifies that there is communicaiton with the CPU. If there is a red light, but no green one, it's likely the micro-SD card does not have Linux properly installed.

The RasPi 5 has a single LED that blinks both red and green.

- For Ubuntu, you should see a rainbow colored splash screen on the monitor, then the Ubuntu desktop should initialize.

**IMPORTANT**: Never turn the RasPi off without first shutting Linux down with the **``halt``** or similar command. Doing so can damage the operating system and possibly even the RasPi itself.

### Initial Ubuntu Desktop configuration

If you are installing Raspbian, skip to the next section.

A welcome screen should open on the monitor. Perform the following steps:

- On the *Welcome* window, choose your language and click **Continue**.
- On the *Keyboard layout* window, choose your layout and click **Continue**.
- On the *Wireless* window, if you are not using a hard-wired Ethernet, click **Connect** and configure a Wi-Fi network. You must know the network SSID and will probably be prompted for a password.
- On the *Where are you?* window, choose your time zone.
- On the *Who are you?* window, set the following values:
    - Set your name.
    - Set your computerâ€™s name (host name).
    - For a user name and password ``pi`` is recommended as it is documented in the reminder of this document.
    - For the last option, **Log in automatically** is recommended.
    - Click **Continue**.
 - The install process will take a number of minutes configuring and will reboot the computer.
 - When the system finishes rebooting, an *Online Accounts* window should appear. Click **Skip**.
 - Click **Next** at the *Enable Ubuntu Pro* window.
 - Choose an option on the *Help Improve Ubuntu* window and click **Next**.
 - Click **Next** at the *Privacy* window.
 - Click **Done** at the *Ready to go* window.

Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 should now be installed.
 
### Initial Raspbian Desktop configuration

If you are installing Ubuntu, skip this section.

To install and configure Raspbian, perform the following steps:

- At the *Welcome to the Raspberry Pi Desktop!* window => click **Next**.
- At the *Set Country* window - choose your country, language and time zone and click **Next**.
- At the *Create User* window - The user name must be ``pi``.
- At the *Set up screen* window - Check the box if you see a black box around the monitor and click **Next**.
- At the *Select WiFi Network* window - choose your network and click **Next**.
    - At the *Enter WiFi Password* window, enter the password and click **Next**.
- At the *Update Software* window - click **Skip** - the upgrade will be done from a terminal session.
- At the *Setup complete* window - click **Done** or **Restart**.

### Setting up the SSH server on Ubuntu

If you are installing Raspbian, skip to the next section.

The secure shell (SSH) server is not installed by default on Ubuntu desktop. Install it so you can access your system remotely. To do so, perform the following steps:

- Open a terminal session by right-clicking the mouse anywhere on the desktop and choosing **Open in Terminal**. You should see a console window open.
- Show the contents of the ``/etc/os-release`` file just to confirm the Ubuntu release level.

    **``$ cat /etc/os-release``**
    
    ```
    PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS"
    NAME="Ubuntu"
    VERSION_ID="22.04"
    VERSION="22.04.2 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"
    ...
    ```
    
- Update and upgrade your system which installs the latest code for all installed packages.
    
    **``$ sudo apt-get update ``**
    
    ``...``

    **``$ sudo apt-get upgrade -y ``**
    
    ``...``

- Install the ``openssh-server`` package, with the following command.  You will be prompted for your password.
    
    **``$ sudo apt-get install -y openssh-server ``**
    
    ``[sudo] password for pi:``

- After it installs **``sshd``** should be running. Verify with the following command:

    **``$ service sshd status``**
    
    ```
    ...
    Active: active (running) 
    ...
    ```
### Setting up the SSH server on Raspbian

If you are installing Ubuntu, skip this section.

The secure shell (SSH) server is installed by default on Raspbian, but not running. 

To start it now, and enable it at boot time, perform the following steps:

- Click the red Raspberry icon in the upper left corner, then in the drop-down menu choose **Accessories** then **Terminal**. 

- From the terminal session, start the SSH server for the current session.

    **``$ systemctl start ssh``**

- Set the SSH server to start at boot time.

    **``$ systemctl enable ssh``**
    
### Start a terminal or SSH session

You can continue to work from a *terminal session* or you can *SSH in* to your new Linux system.  To SSH in, perform the following steps.

- Get your IP address. You should have either a Wi-Fi (``wlan0``) or a hard-wired (``eth0``) connection. To verify, enter the following command. 

    **``$ ip a``**
    ```
    1: lo:
    ...
    2: eth0:
    ...
    3: wlan0:
    ...
    inet 192.168.1.229
    ```

SSH as the user ``pi``, if you want to continue from another system. You can use **putty** to SSH in from a Windows box, or just use the **``ssh``** command from a Linux or macOS console.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not run as ``root``. Doing so will almost certainly screw up your system. 
Users other than ``pi`` ideally will work as the environment variable ``$HOME`` is used in scripts, however, this has never been tested.

## Install and use ovos-tools

The **``ovos-tools``** repo has been developed to help with the installation, configuration, use and testing of the free and open personal voice assistants.

To install **``ovos-tools``** perform the following steps:
  
- Install **``git``** and **``vim``** as they are needed shortly.

    **``$ sudo apt-get install -y git vim``**
    
    **``...``**
    
- Make **``vim``** the default editor.

    **``$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/editor editor /usr/bin/vim 100``**
    
    ``update-alternatives: using /usr/bin/vim to provide /usr/bin/editor (editor) in auto mode``
    
- Allow members of the ``sudo`` group to be able to run **``sudo``** commands without a password, by adding **``NOPASSWD:``** to the line near the bottom of the file.

    **``$ sudo visudo``**

    ```
    ...
    %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
    ...
    ```

- Clone the **``ovos-tools``** package in the ``pi`` home directory with the following commands:

    **``$ git clone https://github.com/mike99mac/ovos-tools.git``**
    
    ```
    Cloning into 'ovos-tools'...
    ...
    Resolving deltas: 100% (366/366), done.
    ```
    
- Change to the newly installed directory and run the setup script. It will copy scripts to the directory ``/usr/local/sbin`` which is in the default ``PATH``.

    **``$ cd ovos-tools``**
    
    **``$ sudo ./setup.sh``**
    
    ```
    Copying all scripts to /usr/local/sbin ... 
    Success!  There are new scripts in your /usr/local/sbin/ directory
    ```
    
    The **``ovos-tools``** repo is now installed.
    
### Further customize 

The script **``install1``**, in the **``ovos-tools``** package you just installed, runs many commands and thus saves typing, time and possible errors.

It performs the following tasks:

- Installs the **``mlocate mpc mpd net-tools pandoc python3 python3-pip python3-rpi.gpio python3.10-venv``** packages
- Sets  **``vim``** to a better color scheme and turns off the annoying auto-indent features
- Adds needed groups to users ``pi`` and ``mpd``
- Copies a ``.bash_profile`` to the user's home directory
- Turns ``default`` and ``vc4`` audio off and does not disable monitor overscan in the Linux boot parameters file.
- Changes a line in the **``rsyslog``** configuration file to prevent *kernel message floods*
- Copies a **``systemctl``** configuration file to mount ``/var/log/`` in a ``tmpfs`` which helps prolong the life of the micro-SD card
- Sets **``pulseaudio``** to start as a system service at boot time, and allows anonymous access so audio services work
- Configures **``mpd``**, the music player daemon, which plays most of the sound
- Turns off **``bluetooth``** as Linux makes connecting to it difficult, while most amplifiers make it easy

To run **``intall1``**, perform the following steps:

- First verify it is in your ``PATH`` with the **``which``** command.

    **``$ which install1``**
    
    ``/usr/local/sbin/install1``

- Run the **``install1``** script in the home directory and send ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` to a file.  You may want to reference that file in case of errors. This step will take a couple of minutes.

    **``$ cd``**
    
    **``$ install1 2>&1 | tee install1.out``**
    
    ``...``
    
### Test the changes

- Test your environment with the newly installed **``lsenv``** script which reports on many aspects of your Linux system.

    **``$ lsenv``**
    
    ```
              **TODO:** get correct output 
    ```
    
The output shows that:

- TODO: rework list
- There is one **``pulseaudio``** process running, but it does not have **``--system``** as a parameter.
- Useful information such as IP address, the CPU temperature, root file system, CPU and memory usage.
- None of the file systems frequently written to are mounted as in-memory ``tmpfs`` file systems.

### Test changes of install1 script
Some of the changes made by **``install1``** will not be realized until boot time. To test this, perform the following steps:

- Reboot your system

    **``$ sudo reboot``**
    
- Restart your SSH session when it comes back up.
- Run the same script again to see how the environment has changed.

    **``$ lsenv``**
    
    ````
              **TODO:** get correct output 
    ````
    
You should see three changes:

- The one **``pulseaudio``** process shows a **``--system``** parameter which is vital to audio output working correctly.
- The **``/var/log/``** directory is now an in-memory ``tmpfs`` file system.

## Test microphone and speakers

It is important to know your microphone and speakers are working. 
There are scripts in *ovos-tools* named **``testrecord``** and **``testplay``**. 
They are wrappers around the **``arecord``** and **``aplay``** commands designed to make it easier to test recording audio to a file and playing it back on the speaker(s).

- To test your microphone and speakers, issue the following command then speak for up to five seconds. 

    **``$ testrecord``**
    
    ```
    Testing your microphone for 5 seconds - SAY SOMETHING!
    INFO: running command: arecord -r 44100  -f S24_LE -d 5 /tmp/test-mic.wav
    Recording WAVE '/tmp/test-mic.wav' : Signed 24 bit Little Endian, Rate 44100 Hz, Mono
    Calling testplay to play back the recording ...
    Playing WAVE '/tmp/test-mic.wav' : Signed 24 bit Little Endian, Rate 44100 Hz, Mono
    ```
    
You should hear your words played back to you. If you do not, you must debug the issues - there's no sense in going forward without a microphone and speaker(s).

At this point your system should have a solid sound and microphone stack running, especially **``mpd``** and **``pulseaudio``**, and all software necessary for the installation of Minimy.

## Install and configure OVOS 

Install OVOS by performing the following tasks:

- Install OVOS with the ``installovos`` command 
```
$ installovos 2>&1 | tee -a installovos.out
```
This should take about 10 minutes

- Reboot the system

```
$ sudo reboot
```

Start an SSH session when the system comes back up. You should notice the prompt ``(ovos)`` showing that you are in a virtual environment.

    
### Configure OVOS
**TODO** pick up here 

## Run OVOS 
The scripts **``startovos``** and **``stopovos``** are used to start and stop processes. 
Each skill and service run as process and use the message bus or file system to synchronize. 
Their output is written to the ``logs/`` directory under the main install directory. 

The system relies on the environment variables ``PYTHONPATH``, ``SVA_BASE_DIR`` and ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` which are set in **``startminimy``** 
with this code:

    ...
    export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/minimy:$HOME/minimy/venv_ngv/lib/python3.10/site-packages"
    export SVA_BASE_DIR="$HOME/minimy"
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="$HOME/minimy/install/my-google-key.json"
    ...

- Start Minimy, ensuring it is run from the base directory, as follows.

    **``(venv_ngv) $ cd $HOME/minimy``**
    
    **``(venv_ngv) $ ./startminimy``**
    
    ``...``
    
- Run **``lsenv``** again to see how your environment has changed.    

    **``$ lsenv``**

    ```

    ```
You should see two changes:

- Minimy is now running - the output showing user and system skill processes.
- The two minimy file systems frequently written to are now mounted over in-memory ``tmpfs``'s.

## The buttons process

The smart boombox model with the RasPi on-board has three pushbuttons on the front panel to allow quick access to *previous track*, *pause/resume*, and *next track* operations. If you hold the middle button for more that two seconds, it does a *stop* function, which also clears the music queue.  A new **``buttons``** system skill traps button presses and sends corresponding messages to the bus.

If you want to add buttons to your enclosure, attach them to the following GPIO pins:

    +-----+--------+-------------------------------+
    | Pin | Label  | Description                   |
    |-----|--------|-------------------------------|
    | 9   | GND    | Ground common to all buttons  |
    | 11  | GPIO17 | Previous track                |
    | 13  | GPIO27 | Pause/resume                  |
    | 15  | GPIO22 | Next track                    |
    +-----+--------+-------------------------------+
    
Here is a source of purchasing pushbuttons: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C8C53DM  

**TODO:** On the other boombox model, the computer is a RasPi 400 which is *offboard*, and the GPIO pins are not easily accessible. That will need new code to use the arrow keys on the RasPi 400 for the same function.

# Debugging
Maybe everything will work perfectly the first time, and you won't have to debug (but we know how that goes :))

Following are some debugging resources.

- Many, many debug statements have been added to the code.  In most classes, every function has at least one log statement when in debug mode with the class, the function, and the parameters passed. 

- Log files are in ``$HOME/minimy/logs``.  
    - Show the log files.
   
        **``$ cd $HOME/minimy/logs``**
        
        **``$ ls``**
        
        ``intent.log  media_player.log  skills.log  stt.log  tts.log``
   
    - When Minimy is running, you can watch all the log files get populated in real time with the following command:

        **``tail -f *``**
        
- There is an HTML file with JavaScript code that displays the message bus in real time. If you do not have a Web server running, you must view it from the local host.
    - Start a browser on the box you're installing on and point it to ``file:///home/pi/minimy/display/sysmon.html``
    - You should see all messages written to the message bus and the associated data.
      
- The **``sortlogs``** script - merges and sorts all the log files by timestamp and saves them to ``/tmp``. The merged output is often easier to peruse than the individual files.

    ```
    $ cat sortlogs
    #!/bin/bash
    #
    # sortlogs - merge and sort all log files
    #
    tmpFile="all.logs"
    cd $HOME/minimy/logs
    if [ -f $tmpFile ]; then                   # old one exists
      rm $tmpFile
    fi
    for i in *.log; do                         # copy all log files
      cat $i >> $tmpFile
    done
    outFile="/tmp/logs-`date +\"%F-%T\"`"
    sort $tmpFile > $outFile                   # sort by timestamp
    echo "sorted logs saved to: $outFile"
    ```
	
- The **``stopminimy``** script calls **``sortlogs``** so every time you stop Minimy, there is a new log file copied to ``/tmp/`` which persists across the starting and stopping of Minimy, unlike ``$HOME/minimy/tmp/``.

    ```
	$ stopminimy
	...
    killing process: pi        952424       1 10 16:25 pts/3    00:00:11 python3 framework/services/input/buttons.py ...
    killing process: pi        952425       1  7 16:25 pts/3    00:00:08 python3 framework/services/input/mic.py ...
    sorted logs saved to: /tmp/logs-2023-07-01-16:27:34
    ```
- There's a ``RELEASE-NOTES.md`` and ``TODO.md`` that show a history of the project and a wish list of things to do.
- Google searches, of course ...
- You can email me at mike99mac at gmail.com - can't promise anything, but I will try.

## Afterthought

One of my mantras is *Less is more*. I like minimy because it is a **Mini-My**croft. Here is a rough estimate of the lines of Python code in the three projects as of May 2023:
```
            Repo         Loc           files
    mycroft-core       38074             229
       ovos-core       18067             238
minimy-mike99mac        9900              79
```
So OVOS is half the size of Mycroft, and Minimy is about half again smaller.
